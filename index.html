            <p>Ready to take Olympic weightlifting more seriously? This program is for anyone looking to sharpen their lifts and maybe step onto a competition platform—without dropping everything else you love training.
            We use your 1-rep maxes to tailor each session, so the work is specific to you—your strength, your goals.
            Expect focused progress in Snatch, Clean & Jerk, and whole lot of Squats, with optional comp prep blocks and smart accessory work.</p>
